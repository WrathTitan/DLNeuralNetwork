DL Neural Network Model in Python for Suicidal Ideation Detection

Inside StructuredModel directory run the 2layerNNver2.py file to run the model.
Prior to running the model make sure the following requirements are met: matplotlib, numpy, and vaderSentiment

In Unstructured Programs For Testing directory there are 2 files, webscraping and twitter code which are used to obtain test data from those websites.
In addition data can also be obtained from Reddit. The filtered data is obtained in superfilteredFinal.csv file which contains each line in comma separate values obtained from
the vaderSentiment library which provides us with 4 key features, positivity, negativity, neutral and overall sentiment of the statement.

Obtaining the overall result we conclude that the gradient descent works well and converges.

Future Updates: More test data is required to do further analysis.
Further optimisation and additional updates will be made.
